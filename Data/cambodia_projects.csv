rice_sdp_01,Canal Rehabilitation,Chhuk Khsach ,Kampong Thom,12.391061,105.114631,14750000,2019-02-01,2021-02-01,"The Development of Climate Resilient Rice Value Chain Infrastructure component of the program is designed to invest in priority infrastructure, including rehabilitation and climate proofing of existing irrigation systems in the three major rice-producing provinces: Battambang, Kampong Thom, and Prey Veng. The subproject aims to rehabilitate the 9.140 kilometer secondary canal (Chhuk Ksach canal No.3), including canal associated structures; expecting to increase the income of 3,258 households and more than 15,550 beneficiaries in nine villages of three communes in Kampong Thom.  The subproject includes also some associated investments, such as support for water user associations, land leveling demonstration or improvement of access roads. This main water gate regulates the water flow, allowing up to 3 cubic meter pro second. The canal has small water gates, along its 9,140 kilometers, to block and divert the water to both sides, irrigating 1,690 hectares of rice fields in nine villages: Thnal Cheat, Samroung, Charktolouk, Khdarmar, Chhuk Ksach, Boeung Choeung, Boeung Kandal and Boeung Thbong.","Before the project, the Chhuk Ksach canal No.3 in Kampong Thom faced challenges like dilapidated infrastructure and unreliable water supply, affecting nine villages' rice production. With the project, 6 km of earth-moving work and rehabilitation efforts were undertaken, improving canal structures and widening a bypass canal. Additionally, support for water user associations, technical extension services, and access to seeds and credit were provided. As a result, rice production improved, incomes rose, and communities became more resilient to climate challenges."
rice_sdp_04,Cash for Works (CFW) Road Rehabilitation ,Santuk,Kampong Thom,12.563653,105.045605,10000000,2018-07-01,2020-07-01,"The Santuk Commune Road Rehabilitation Project, running from July 2018 to July 2020, addressed the urgent need for improved road infrastructure in Santuk commune. Before the project, deteriorating roads hindered mobility and access to essential services. Using the Community-Based Workfare program, it engaged residents, particularly the disadvantaged, in rehabilitation efforts to alleviate poverty and enhance livelihoods. The project focused on grading and paving roads with laterite to ensure long-term durability. It also aimed to foster community unity and participation through engagement initiatives. Ultimately, the project sought to create lasting improvements in road accessibility and socio-economic opportunities for Tipau commune residents.","Through the Community-Based Workfare (CFW) program, the EFAP rehabilitated a total of 4377 meters of roads. This involved grading and paving with laterite, significantly improving their condition.

EFAP –AF implemented a payment system where workers received KHR 8,000 (US$2) per cubic meter of soil work and KHR 2,000 (US$0.5) per square meter of grass turfing. Notably, 34% of households participating in the CFW program were economically poor. Despite challenges, the program proved to be financially beneficial for participants, with an average earnings of KHR 522 (US$130.50) per person.

Following the project's completion, surveys revealed multiple positive outcomes. Apart from the evident improvement in road infrastructure, there was an enhanced accessibility to essential services such as schools and health centers. Furthermore, each CFW canal rehabilitation positively impacted an average of 110 hectares and 209 households, fostering broader community development."
